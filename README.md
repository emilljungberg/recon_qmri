# Advanced recon for quantitative MRI
Many advanced reconstruction techniques have been proposed for quantitative MRI, and plenty have shown great promise. However, it can be difficult to understand how these techniques and the regularisation parameters affects the quantitative results, especially when it comes to regularisation along the parameter dimension (TE, TR, TI, FA, etc.). This repository contains a set of simulation tools for building greater understanding of these methods. I hope you find them as useful as I do.
